## 💡 Inspiration

Tracking workouts can feel tedious, and knowing when to increase the weight is even harder.  
Powered by Google Gemini, we're three lifters building an **AI-powered strength coach** that turns your data into meaningful, personalized guidance. 
We're helping users progress, recover smarter, and stay consistent.



## 🚀 What It Does

**Superlift** is your personal strength coach that:

- 📝 Lets you log workouts manually (sets, reps, weight)  
- 🤖 Uses **Google Gemini** to analyze training trends and estimate your **1RM**  
- 💪 Gives personalized feedback after each workout, suggesting intelligent load increases  
- 📊 Displays simple, intuitive charts to visualize your strength progression  
- 🎙️ Allows **on-demand AI consulting** — ask questions like “Why is my bench stagnating?” and get context-aware answers


**Disclaimer:** Superlift is not a certified personal trainer, and is only meant to be used as a tool. Please consult your doctor or physical therapist before taking any advice.
